# hello_world
a test repository to learn git

I'm writing this file at 3am because I can't sleep. Today, I played a lot of Overwatch with my brother. We had the always delictable Taco in a Bag, then ordered some Pizza Hut for dinner. We probably lost more games than we won today. It felt fun to play games together, but it didn't feel productive. I'm hoping tomorrow will be more productive. I'm going to talk to my brother tomorrow about making a procedural "rogue-like" game.
